# Analytic Function Concepts

## Data Windows

<pre>
SELECT quarter(payment_date) quarter, 
 monthname(payment_date) month_nm, 
 sum(amount) monthly_sales, 
 <b>max(sum(amount)) 
    over () max_overall_sales,</b>/*controlled by where and group by and return the highest monthly total payment in 2005*/
 <b>max(sum(amount))
    over (partition by quarter(payment_date)) max_qrtr_sales</b> /*controlled by where and group by and return the highest monthly total payment in each quarter in 2005*/
FROM payment 
WHERE year(payment_date) = 2005
GROUP BY quarter(payment_date), monthname(payment_date);
</pre>

The analytic functions used to generate these additional columns group rows into two different sets: one set containing all rows in the same quarter and another set containing all of the rows. To accommodate this type of analysis, analytic functions include the ability to group rows into *windows*, which effectively partition the data for use by the analytic function without changing the overall result set. Windows are defined using the `over` clause combined with an optional `partition` by subclause. In the previous query, both analytic functions include an over clause, but the first one is empty, indicating that the window should include the entire result set, whereas the second one specifies that the window should include only rows within the same quarter. Data windows may contain anywhere from a single row to all of the rows in the result set, and different analytic functions can define different data windows.

## Localized Sorting

<pre>
SELECT quarter(payment_date) quarter, 
 monthname(payment_date) month_nm, 
 sum(amount) monthly_sales, 
 <b>rank() over (order by sum(amount) desc)</b> sales_rank /* order by only controls the rank()*/
FROM payment
WHERE year(payment_date) = 2005
GROUP BY quarter(payment_date), monthname(payment_date)
ORDER BY 1, month(payment_date);/* order by only controls the presentation*/
</pre> 

or you may insert `partition by quarter(payment_date)` into the `over()` above to obtain rank within each quarter.

# Ranking

## Ranking Functions 

There are multiple ranking functions available in the SQL standard, with each one taking a different approach to how ties are handled: 

`row_number`

Returns a unique number for each row, with rankings arbitrarily assigned in case of a tie

`rank` 

Returns the same ranking in case of a tie, with gaps in the rankings 

`dense_rank`

Returns the same ranking in case of a tie, with no gaps in the rankings

<pre>
SELECT customer_id, count(*) num_rentals, 
 row_number() over (order by count(*) desc) row_number_rnk, 
 rank() over (order by count(*) desc) rank_rnk, 
 dense_rank() over (order by count(*) desc) dense_rank_rnk 
FROM rental
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY 2 desc;
</pre>

| customer_id | num_rentals | row_number_rnk | rank_rnk | dense_rank_rnk |
| :---------- | ----------- | -------------- | -------- | -------------: |
| 144         | 42          | 3              | 3        |              3 |
| 236         | 42          | 4              | 3        |              3 |
| <b>75</b>   | <b>41</b>   | <b>5</b>       | <b>5</b> |       <b>4</b> |

To get back to the original request, how would you identify the top 10 customers? There are three possible solutions:

* Use the row_number function to identify customers ranked from 1 to 10, which results in exactly 10 customers in this example, but in other cases might exclude customers having the same number of rentals as the 10th ranked customer.

* Use the rank function to identify customers ranked 10 or less, which also results in exactly 10 customers.

* Use the dense_rank function to identify customers ranked 10 or less, which yields a list of 37 customers.

## Generating Multiple Rankings

<pre>
SELECT customer_id, 
 monthname(rental_date) rental_month, 
 count(*) num_rentals, 
 rank() over (<b>partition by monthname(rental_date) </b>
 order by count(*) desc) rank_rnk 
FROM rental
GROUP BY customer_id, monthname(rental_date)
ORDER BY 2, 3 desc;
</pre>

so that rank() starts from 1 for each month.

Looking at the results, you can see that the rankings are reset to 1 for each month. In order to generate the desired results for the marketing department (top five custom‚Äê ers from each month), you can simply wrap the previous query in a subquery and add a filter condition to exclude any rows with a ranking higher than five:

<pre>
SELECT customer_id, rental_month, num_rentals, rank_rnk ranking
FROM 
(SELECT customer_id,
monthname(rental_date) rental_month, count(*) num_rentals,
rank() over (partition by monthname(rental_date) order by count(*) desc) rank_rnk
FROM rental
GROUP BY customer_id, monthname(rental_date) 
) cust_rankings 
<b>WHERE rank_rnk <= 5</b>
ORDER BY rental_month, num_rentals desc, rank_rnk;
</pre>

Since analytic functions can be used only in the SELECT clause, you will often need to **nest queries** if you need to do any filtering or grouping based on the results from the analytic function.
