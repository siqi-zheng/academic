> This tutorial was designed to illustrate a sample slide for teaching bootstrap sampling using .Rmd file.

Teaching bootstrapping to students who were new to statistics can be difficult, especially when they were taught about hypothesis testing (z-test) before bootstrapping. During my actual practice, I found it useful to discuss the similarities between these two methods then the differences. 

An introduction about why we need such method can always be inspiring and motivating.
