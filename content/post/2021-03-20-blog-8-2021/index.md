This is the seventh post of the series Learning Stats at UofT. In case you did not read my last post, here is the introudction.

The fundamental statistics courses at UofT are normally unchanged, at least from my experience in the past three years. Still, I think it is worth devoting some blogs to this topic. Before starting the introduction to courses, I would like to spend some time on the programs offered by DoSS.

I am a student in Applied Statistics Specialist, or Method and Application, at UofT. Though there were some changes in the requirements, the main focus of the two programs is the same. In particular, you will go through some fundamentals in R and (Frequentist) statistics in your first two years, and take upper year courses in some advanced topics. Compared to the Theory one, you do not need to take so many courses in theory, but you need to choose a focus depending on your interest. The focus seemed less important, but I gave a lot of thoughts about it in my past years. So I would like to share some of them with you. Note that all of these can be found on the official website of Arts & Science, and I hope this paragraph serves well as an introduction.

By meeting with a Vic alumnus, I summarize a set of core skills that are important for our future career. This is the last part of the core skills.

## Detail-oriented 

In workplace, noticing the details means you are careful every pieces of your writing and avoid making errors due to carelessness. In real life, the skill refer to the followings. Be curious about the surroundings and the environment. Catch sight of the beautiful and show your appreciation. Remark on the unusual and take a note of it. Notice the changing seasons and take a photo of them. Savour the moment, whether you are walking to work, eating lunch or talking to friends. Be aware of the world around you and what you are feeling. You are not a robot, so you should not only work or study. Lastly, reflecting on your experiences will help you appreciate what matters to you (credit to Chad Jankowski).

## Communication Skills

Communication is every where. You need to communicate verbally or in writing with family, friends, colleagues and neighbours. You apply communication skills at home, work, school or in your local community. Therefore, you need to think of your past communications as the cornerstones of your life and invest time in enhancing these skills. Building these connections skillfully will support and enrich you every day (credit to Chad Jankowski).

In workplace, communication should be clear and precise. Sometimes you need to be a bit diplomatic when you talk to people, sometimes you need to be bold to speak up your needs. People should develop the ability to communicate differently with various people in many contexts.
